# CataTinder 

## Description
Catatinder is a delightful website designed exclusively for our feline friends. This aims to connect cats with fellow felines for playful interactions, companionship, and maybe even a little bit of romance (if they're into that sort of thing). Whether your cat is seeking a new buddy for laser pointer sessions, a snuggle partner for nap time, or simply someone to exchange purrs with, Catatinder provides a platform for cats to meet, chat, and form lasting connections.

## Features
- **Purrfile Creation**: Cats can create purrsonalized profiles showcasing their unique personalities, favorite toys, and preferred nap spots.
- **Whisker-ific Matching Algorithm**: Catatinder utilizes a sophisticated matching algorithm to pair cats based on their purrsonal interests and compatibility.
- **Paw-some Photo Sharing**: Cats can share photos of their majestic poses, silly antics, and adorable whiskers with their fellow felines.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Purrgrammed in MeowngoDB
- **Frontend**: Clawtastic HTML and CSS
